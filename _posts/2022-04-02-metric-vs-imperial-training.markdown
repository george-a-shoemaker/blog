Now that I'm in Mexico City and training with [Running Mafia][running-mafia], it makes sense to switch to switch from miles to kilometers. When in Rome.

Switching units is kind of like learning a new language. It's far better to have an intuitive sense of the target unit, rather than translate to your "native" unit. Unfortunately I can only think in miles, so here are some strategies to reason about kilometers if you're used to miles.

## Converting distances

These are conversion you can do in your head. 1 miles is slightly more than 1.6km. With this is mind we can do approximations with addition and division by 2 and 10. Pretty easy to do in your noggin. ðŸ¤“

### Convert Miles => Kilometers

#### Given M miles:
- Divide M by 2
- Divide M by 10
- Add both to M

#### For example let M = 5mi
- 5/2 = 2.5
- 5/10 = 0.5
- 2.5 + 0.5 + 5 = 8

*5mi is approximately 8km*. This approximation will *underestimate* the distance in kilometers by < 1%

### Convert Kilometers => Miles

#### Given K kilometers:
- Divide K by 2
- Divide K by 10
- Add them

#### For example let K = 8km
1. 8/2 = 4
2. 8/10 = 0.8
3. 4 + 0.8 = 4.8

*8km is approximately 4.8mi.* This approximation *understimates* the distance in miles by about 4%.
