\~or\~ why air pollutions still matters in Mexico's capitol

It appears that electric cars are the future. Every major car manufacturer is already developing them and they are considered a necesarry ingredient of the most urgent plans to build a carbon-neutral future. To make electric cars ubiquitous we need charging stations to be as bountiful as gas stations. In the US there's lots of public and private money being poured into getting the infrastrucuture built. For example my sister works for a charging station startup, Volta Charging.

But what is the state of affairs for electric vehicles in Mexico? Here are my observations as a resident of Mexico City.

## Beat Tesla

The lone example of electric cars in Mexico City is the high-end ride hailng service, Beat Tesla. Their fleet consists entirely of Tesla vehicles, and they've been operating in the city since late 2020. Beyond these vehicles I don't recall seeing any other electric car, Tesla or otherwise.

You might think of Tesla as a software company that happens to sell cars. What I'm about to tell you is heresay from my roommate, so take it with a grain of salt. One of the aims of Beat Tesla is to gather data about driving conditions in Mexico City in service of self driving software. This makes of ton of sense and is a fascinating problem.

On paper, the driving "rules" are nearly identical between the US and Mexico. But driving conventions and infrastructure very greatly, such that successful self driving technology in Austin, Texas (Tesla headquarters) will fail miserably in Mexico. For example stop signs essentially don't exist in Mexico. Therefore there is a nuanced rolling negotiation happens when two drivers come upon an unmarked intersection. Humans are great at nuance. Computers, not so much.

## Electric Car infrastructure

There isn't any

## Electrified public transit

- electric bus
- subway

## Electric bikes

- Connondale and Trek
- electric moped rental




I don't anticipate the world will be dramatically better when we replace conventional cars with electric ones. Electric cars inherit nearly all the same problems as their conventional counterpart: space inneficient, resource intensive to manufacture, inherintly dangerous at high speed, the required infrastructure is extremely expensive to build and maintain.

As populations continue to grow, we're constantly hitting the limits of a car-centric infrastructure. Freeways cannot be improved through expansion when the cities they serve have limited surface streets and parking. Trasportation is not a technology problem, it's political one. And as of now, the US largely lacks the political will to choose bikes, buses, trains and density over more freeways and sprawling suburbs. What is Musk's hyperloop if not a more expensive freeway? But I digress...

Electric vehicles have one outstanding attribute that I'm looking forward to: zero tail pipe emissions. (Of course producing the electricity most likely required the burning of fossil fuels at the time of writing this.) The adverse health effects of air pollution alone cannot be understated. The number of deaths caused by the burning of fossil fuels is in the ballpark of [9 million people each year](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487?via%3Dihub).

And Mexico City, my current home, is notorious for it's bad air quality. In the early 90s, air pollution was at it's peak making Mexico City the [most polluted city in the world at the time](https://earth.org/air-pollution-in-mexico-city/). The situation has turned around such that the air quality isn't remarkably good or bad. It's what you'd expect from a major city. Things improved thanks to a mix of regulation of industry and improved emissions technology in cars. For example cars with catalytic converts have replaced the once ubiquitious VW Bug which was proudly manufactured in neighboring Puebla until 2003.

Despite a dramatic improvement air quality, Mexico City won't be a "healthy" place to live until car emissions are dramatically cut (most likely with the rise of electric vehices). The fact that the city is at altitude and has excellent sunny weather makes car emissions especially nasty for two reasons: 1. heavy pollutants collect at the surface level in the low pressure atmosphere at 7300ft of altitude. 2. The strong UV radiation at altitude interacts with pollutants to produce Ozone. Ozone is great in the upper atmosphere as a meanst to protect us from solar radition. But when it's at ground level, it's a nasty and volatile compound that [damages tissues in the body](https://www.epa.gov/ozone-pollution-and-your-patients-health/health-effects-ozone-general-population#respiratory).
