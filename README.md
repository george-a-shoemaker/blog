Run `./local-serve.sh` to serve the site on local host.

I set this up with help from this [video series](https://youtu.be/EmSrQCDsMv4) by [Bill Raymond](https://github.com/BillRaymond)

I'm using the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes)
The theme is installed as a "remote theme" as suggested in the [quick start guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
